            <p><strong>FinRL</strong> is an open-source framework for deep reinforcement learning in finance.
            <br> <br>
            <strong><em>What makes it different?</em></strong>
            <br>
            <strong>End-to-end pipeline:</strong> It provides an entire workflow from data preprocessing to environment setup, agent training, backtesting, and evaluation within a unified framework.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>RL focus:</strong> Instead of separate prediction or optimization components, it uses RL agents that directly learn policies for trading, capturing complex relationships and adapting dynamically to changing markets. 
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Modular:</strong> Its layered structure allows users to plug in different environments (e.g., stocks, cryptos), state features, reward functions, and DRL algorithms, promoting experimentation and expansion. </p>
            
            <p>I integrated a custom trading environment into the existing FinRL pipeline and adapted environment variables/functions, and evaluated PPO agents under the new setup.</p>
